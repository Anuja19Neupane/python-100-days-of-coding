        Maybe, it's the way you say my name
        Maybe, it's the way you play your game
        But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
        But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you
        And I've heard of a <em>love</em> that comes once in a lifetime
        And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
        'Cause I'm in a field of <strong>dandelions</strong>
        Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine

        <p>And I see forever in your eyes
        I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
        Wishing on  all of the time
        Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
        Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
        I think that you are the one for me
        'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
        When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free
